# How to install

* Open a terminal and execute the following line:
```{.bash execute="false"}
# install of dyndocker
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcqls/dyndocker/master/install-dyndocker.sh)"
```
* After installation of atom editor, install the atom-dyndocker, language-dyndoc and language-r packages.
With apm in the PATH, this can be done via
```{.bash execute="false"}
apm install atom-dyndocker
apm install language-dyndoc
apm install language-r

* Every dyndoc or latex document has to be located in the ~/dyndocker directory.
* Examples (TODO)
